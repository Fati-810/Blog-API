# Blog-API

This is a **full-stack blog web application** that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. It features a clean user interface with responsive design and leverages an Express.js REST API as its backend. The app is **ideal** for learning or demonstrating **CRUD operations** with a **simple UI**.

## Features
📝 Create Post – Add a new blog post with title, content, and author.

📖 View Posts – Homepage displays a list of blog entries dynamically.

✏️ Edit Post – Update existing blog content.

🗑 Delete Post – Remove any post with one click.

📅 Auto Timestamping – Posts include the creation date.

💻 Clean UI – Responsive, minimal front-end built with EJS and custom CSS.

🔁 Live Updates – Uses Axios to communicate with the backend API.

🧠 In-Memory Data – No database used; data stored in memory (ideal for demonstration or learning).

## Technical Overview (Behind the Scenes) :
